                  People can be motivated by a number of different things:
                  money, time, fear, hunger, love, family, etc. I am, however,
                  motivated by a desire to produce worth-while, high-quality
                  content while collaborating with like-minded individuals
                  working toward a common goal.

                  As Mel Brooks would say, the 2020 quarantine has only turned
                  me mostly insane; but not entirely....yet.

            <p>
              After completing my collegiate career with my audio production
              company audioshire. being the main monetary driver, I found myself
              searching for something more; another avenue of creation,
              development, and growth. Shortly thereafter, I sunk myself into a
              successful Technical Recruiting position as a way to expose myself
              to a myriad of potential career paths. Fairly early on, I
              discovered that my core values aligned with software development
              e.g. constant growth, learning, and building things; it became a
              natural interest and a skill that I have begun to fiercely
              nurture. The same work ethic, collaboration, and discipline that
              made funding my education through a passion project a reality will
              guide me toward a successful software & web development career.
              The next step in my career is ideally on a team of knowledgeable,
              hardworking, and fun developers where I can learn and grow myself
              into an indispensable developer for them.

                When I'm not developing my coding skills (which is rare these
                days), you can usually find me composing, editing, or playing
                music. I certainly try to keep my music abilities genre-fluid,
                but admittedly, my compositions have a strong tendency toward
                classical/instrumental, progressive rock; a la Ã“lafur Arnalds,
                Tycho, or Explosions in the Sky.

              <p>
                The purpose of Moviedex is to help users decide on what movie to
                watch, from a list of saved movies they'd like to watch.
                Moviedex is a React web application that allows users to call a
                public movie API, OMDb, save/delete those movies to/from
                Moviedex's server, and then click a button to randomly generate
                one of those movies as the selected movie to watch.

                tool to get a snapshot view of artists they haven't listened to
                yet. Users are able to enter in a band, artist or musician name
                and Musiciandex will return the respective description of the
