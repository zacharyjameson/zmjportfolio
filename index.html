					<p>Hi there! I'm Zack Jameson, I'm glad you found me.</p>
					<p>I'm a software developer living in Raleigh, NC</p>
					<p>3 things you should know about me:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>I have a passion for learning, growth, and self-development that feeds my increasing interest in software development and web design.</li>
						<li>People can be motivated by a number of different things: money, time, fear, hunger, love, family, etc. I am, however, motivated by a desire to produce worth-while, high-quality content while collaborating with like-minded individuals working toward a common goal.</li>
						<li>As Mel Brooks would say, the 2020 quarantine has only turned me mostly insane; but not entirely....yet.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>And a few services and traits I bring to the table:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development</li>
							<li>A desire to constantly push myself and the team each day to produce more efficient and higher quality content</li>
							<li>Web page design and development</li>
							<li>Human factors and ergnomic considerations</li>
							<li>A positive attitude</li>
						<ul>

            <h2 id="career">Career.</h2>
            <p>After completing my collegiate career with my audio production company audioshire. being the main monetary driver, I found myself searching for something more; another avenue of creation, development, and growth. Shortly thereafter, I sunk myself into a successful Technical Recruiting position as a way to expose myself to a myriad of potential career paths. Fairly early on, I discovered that my core values aligned with software development e.g. constant growth, learning, and building things; it became a natural interest and a skill that I have begun to fiercely nurture. The same work ethic, collaboration, and discipline that made funding my education through a passion project a reality will guide me toward a successful software & web development career. The next step in my career is ideally on a team of knowledgeable, hardworking, and fun developers where I can learn and grow myself into an indispensable developer for them.</p>

              <p>When I'm not developing my coding skills (which is rare these days), you can usually find me composing, editing, or playing music. I certainly try to keep my music abilities genre-fluid, but admittedly, my compositions have a strong tendency toward classical/instrumental, progressive rock; a la Ã“lafur Arnalds, Tycho, or Explosions in the Sky.</p>
